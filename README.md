Generalized linear mixed models
Generalized linear mixed models extend the linear model so that:
The target is linearly related to the factors and covariates via a specified link function.
The target can have a non-normal distribution.
The observations can be correlated.


Generalized linear mixed models cover a wide variety of models, from simple linear regression to complex multilevel models for non-normal longitudinal data.
